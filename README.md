# hydrogendimers
Repository for hydrogen collision-induced absorption spectra.

This github repository contains calculated hydrogen dimer absorption coefficients based on the paper:
Fletcher, Gustaffson and Orton (2017), Hydrogen dimers in giant-planet infrared spectra, submitted to ApJ.

Abstract:
Despite being one of the weakest dimers in nature, the (H$_2$)$_2$ dimer had been identified in low-spectral-resolution 
Voyager/IRIS observations of Jupiter and Saturn.  However, collision-induced H2-H2 opacity databases have only included 
free-to-free transitions and have not previously incorporated dimer contributions, which have both fine-scale structure 
near the S(0) and S(1) quadrupole lines (354 and 587 cm-1, respectively), and broad continuum contributions 
up to Â±50 cm-1 from the line centres.  We develop a new ab initio model for the free-to-bound, bound-to-free and 
bound-to-bound transitions of the hydrogen dimer for a range of temperatures (40-400 K) and para-hydrogen fractions 
(0.2-1.0).  The model is validated against low-temperature laboratory experiments, and used to simulate the spectra of 
the giant planets.  The model reproduces the dimer signatures observed in Voyager/IRIS data near S(0), and generally lowers 
the amount of para-H2 (and the extent of disequilibrium) required to reproduce IRIS observations.  The new dimer database 
permits the first high-resolution (0.5-1.0 cm-1) spectral modelling of dimer spectra near S(0) and S(1) in both Cassini 
Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations of Jupiter and Saturn, and in Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) 
observations of Uranus and Neptune for the first time.
